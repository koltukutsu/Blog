# Sample blog powered by [Truegit](https://truegit.io)

To create a blog on Truegit, you need to do follow these steps:

1. Create a Github repository with a truegit.yaml configuration file at the root folder. You may also fork this sample repository to get started.
2. Install the [Github App](https://bit.ly/3GyRCBG) and give it access to the repository. You can do right after you install the app or configuring an existing installation to give it access to the repository. You can find your Truegit app inside Settings > Applications in your Github dashboard.
3. At this point, your blog should be live. However, to find and manage your blog, you must create an account on [Truegit](https://truegit.io).
